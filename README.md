# DATA_COMIND2022

This data represent a knowledge graph (KG) that has been populated using a set of diagnostic documents provided by the CSTB (Scientific and technical center for building).
This KG contains 51970 triples that describe 2998 product instances, 341 locations, 214 structures and 94 buildings. The construction year of those buildings varies between 1948 and 1997.
We have 1525 products that contain asbestos and 1473 products are asbestos-free. To evaluate our approaches, CRA-Miner and the hybrid approache, we divided the KG data into 3 tiers, and we performed cross-validation.
